## How to release a new version

1. In a new branch `release/vX.Y.Z`, update the [changelog](#changelog) to reflect and summarize all changes in
   the release. This involves:
   1. Running `unclog build -u` and copy pasting the output at the top
      of the `CHANGELOG.md` file, making sure to update the header with
      the new version.
   2. Running `unclog release --editor <editor> --version vX.Y.Z` to create a summary of all of the changes
      in this release.
      1. Your text editor will open. Write the release summary, and close the editor.
         1. Make sure to include a comment on whether or not the release contains consensus-breaking changes.
      2. Add this same summary to `CHANGELOG.md` as well.
   3. Committing the updated `CHANGELOG.md` file and `.changelog` directory to the repo.
2. Push this to a branch `release/vX.Y.Z` according to the version number of
   the anticipated release (e.g. `release/v0.18.0`) and open a **draft PR**.
3. If there were changes in the `ibc-derive` crate, we need to publish a new version of that crate.
   1. bump the version in `crates/ibc-derive/Cargo.toml`
   2. Publish `ibc-derive` with `cargo publish -p ibc-derive`
4. Bump all relevant versions in `crates/ibc/Cargo.toml` to the new version and
      push these changes to the release PR.
      + If you released a new version of `ibc-derive` in step 3, make sure to update that dependency.
5. If it's a major release, update the docs as described in the [next
   section](#how-to-update-docs-for-new-major-releases).
6. Run `cargo doc -p ibc --all-features --open` locally to double-check that all the
   documentation compiles and seems up-to-date and coherent. Fix any potential
   issues here and push them to the release PR.
7. Run `cargo publish -p ibc --dry-run` to double-check that publishing will work. Fix
   any potential issues here and push them to the release PR.
8. Mark the PR as **Ready for Review** and incorporate feedback on the release.
9. Once approved, merge the PR, and pull the `main` branch.
10. Run `cargo publish -p ibc`
11. Create a signed tag and push it to GitHub: `git tag -s -a vX.Y.Z`. In the tag
   message, write the version and the link to the corresponding section of the
   changelog + Push the tag with `git push --tags`
12. Once the tag is pushed, create a GitHub release and append
   `[ðŸ“–CHANGELOG](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#vXYZ)`
   to the release description.

All done! ðŸŽ‰

## How to update Docs for new major releases

When a new major version of IBC-rs is released, the following further steps
should be taken:

1. On the `release/vX.Y.Z` branch, remove the deploy action
  (`.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`), for avoiding deploying the docs from
  the release branches.
2. Update `docusaurus.config.js` and set the `lastVersion` to `current`, remove
  all other versions from the config.
3. Each time a new version is released (on docusaurus), drop support from the
  oldest versions.
4. Add the new version sidebar to the list of versioned sidebar
5. Add the version to `versions.json`.
6. Update the latest version (`presets[0].docs.lastVersion`) in
  `docusaurus.config.js`.
7. Add the new version with in `presets[0].docs.versions` in
  `docusaurus.config.js`.
