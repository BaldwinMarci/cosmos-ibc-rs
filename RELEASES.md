## Releases

Our release process is as follows:

1. In a new branch `release/vX.Y.Z`, update the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) to
   reflect and summarize all changes in the release. This involves:
   1. Running `unclog build -u` and copy pasting the output at the top of the
      `CHANGELOG.md` file, making sure to update the header with the new
      version.
   2. Running `unclog release --editor <editor> --version vX.Y.Z` to create a
      summary of all of the changes in this release.
      1. Your text editor will open. Write the release summary, and close the
         editor. Make sure to include a comment on whether or not the release
         contains consensus-breaking changes.
      2. Add this same summary to `CHANGELOG.md` as well.
   3. Committing the updated `CHANGELOG.md` file and `.changelog` directory to
      the repo.
2. Push this to a branch `release/vX.Y.Z` according to the version number of the
   anticipated release (e.g. `release/v0.18.0`) and open a **draft PR**.
3. If there were changes in the `ibc-derive` crate, we need to publish a new
   version of that crate.
   1. bump the version in `crates/ibc-derive/Cargo.toml`
   2. Publish `ibc-derive` with `cargo publish -p ibc-derive`
4. Bump the versions of all crates to the new version in their Cargo.toml and in
   the root `Cargo.toml` as well, and push these changes to the release PR.
   - If you released a new version of `ibc-derive` in step 3, make sure to
        update that dependency.
5. Run `cargo doc -p ibc --all-features --open` locally to double-check that all
   the documentation compiles and seems up-to-date and coherent. Fix any
   potential issues here and push them to the release PR.
6. Run `cargo release --workspace`, which will perform a dry-run of the release
   process, including publishing to crates.io. This step serves to double-check 
   that publishing will work. Fix any potential issues here and push them to the 
   release PR.
7. Mark the PR as **Ready for Review** and incorporate feedback on the release.
8. Once approved, merge the PR, and pull the `main` branch.
9. Create a signed tag `git tag -s -a vX.Y.Z`. In the tag message, write the
   version and the link to the corresponding section of the changelog. Then push
   the tag to GitHub with `git push --tags`.
   - The [release workflow][release.yml] will run the [`release.sh`] script in a
   CI worker.
10. If some crates have not been released, check the cause of the failure and
   act accordingly:
    1. In case of intermittent problems with the registry, rerun the script
      locally to publish any missing crates from this release. This step
      requires the appropriate privileges to push crates to [crates.io].
    2. In case the problems arise from the source files, fix them, bump a new
      patch version (e.g. `v0.48.1`) and repeat the process with its
      corresponding new tag.
11. Once the tag is pushed, create a GitHub release and append
   `[ðŸ“–CHANGELOG](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#vXYZ)`
   to the release description.
