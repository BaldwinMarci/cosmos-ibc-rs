# Attempts to perform a release when a particular tag is pushed. This uses the
# `cargo release`, and assumes that the CRATES_TOKEN secret has been set and
# contains an API token with which we can publish our crates to crates.io.
#
# The `ibc-derive` publishing process is managed manually since it's not
# consistently published with every release.
#
# If release operation fails partway through due to a temporary error (e.g. the
# crate being published depends on the crate published just prior, but the prior
# crate isn't yet available via crates.io), one can simply rerun this workflow.
