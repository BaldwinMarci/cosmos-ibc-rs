# Migration Guide

This section is intended to highlight changes for migrating from a prior stable
version to a more recent version of IBC-rs that may require further information
than presented in our [CHANGELOG](changelog.md).

Please note that the APIs are currently under active development. Once we are
prepared for the first production-level release, we will highlight necessary
steps under this section for migrating to v1.x.x. By the way, if you have any
questions, please reach out to us on [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/discussions).

It should also be noted IBC-rs adheres to [Semantic
Versioning](https://semver.org/), ensuring version compatibility and
predictability.
