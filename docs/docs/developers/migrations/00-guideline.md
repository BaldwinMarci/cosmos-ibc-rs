# Migration Guideline

This section is intended to highlight changes for migrating to/from different stable versions of IBC-rs that may require further information than presented in our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

Please note that the APIs are currently under active development. Once we are prepared for the first production-level release, we will update and highlight necessary steps under this section. By the way, if you have any questions, please reach out to us on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/discussions).

It should also be noted IBC-rs adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), ensuring version compatibility and predictability.
