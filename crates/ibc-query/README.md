# IBC Query

This crate provides a set of utility traits and implementations for querying the
state of an [`ibc-rs`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs) enabled chain.

Implementations contain essential IBC query methods and gRPC query services for
each of the IBC core client, connection, and channel layers.
