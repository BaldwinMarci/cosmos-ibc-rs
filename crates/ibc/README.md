Implementation of the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol ([IBC]) in Rust.
This crate serves as one-stop shop library re-exporting all the implemented data
structures and IBC core, clients and applications modules in the [`ibc-rs`][ibc-rs]
repository.

## Documentation

See documentation on [docs.rs][docs-link].

## Contributing

IBC is specified in English in the [cosmos/ibc
repo](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc). Any protocol changes or clarifications
should be contributed there.

If you're interested in contributing, please take a look at the
[CONTRIBUTING](./../../CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines. We welcome and appreciate
community contributions!

## Third-party clients

Here, we list IBC third-party clients that are compatible with ibc-rs. You
should always audit the implementation of any third-party crate. If you have a
client that you'd like to be added to this list, please open a PR!
