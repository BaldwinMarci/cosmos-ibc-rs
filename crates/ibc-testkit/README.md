# IBC Testkit

`ibc-testkit` is a versatile library that provides essential abstractions and
implementations, fulfilling a dual role of enabling rigorous integration testing
for the [`ibc-rs`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs) implementation while also
aiding host chains in addressing a broad spectrum of testing scenarios during
their integration with `ibc-rs`.
